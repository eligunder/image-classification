# Data Analysis
To classify images, tranfer learning was applied to the cats vs. dogs image set via the MobileNetV2 neural network. After processing the data to be compatible with this model, MobileNetV2 was applied to the image set and achieved >98% accuracy. The python notebook containing this analysis can be found in the file titled 'class_image_proj.ipynb'.
